let name ='mosh';//string literal
let age =30;//number literal
let isApproved=false;//booleans
let firstName=undefined;
let selectedColor=null;

we use null in situations where we want explicitly clear the value of a variable.

for example:we may want to present the user with a list of colors.

if the user has no selection,you want to set the selectedColor variable to null.
