variables: 
==========
use a variable to store data temporarily in the computers memory. So we store our data somewhere, and give that memory location a name. And with this name, we can read the data at the given location in the future.

e.g the boxes you use to organize your stuff. You put your stuff in various boxes, and put a label on each box. With this, you can easily find your stuff. A variable is like a box. What we put inside the box, is the value that we assign to a variable, that's the data, and the label that we put on the box is the name of our variable.

Now let's see Rules  .
let keyword to declare a variable ,
Now we need to give this variable a name,or an identifier and this is like the lable we put on a box. To terminate this declaration with a semi colon.

let name;
console.log(name);
